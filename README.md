# Recalculating...

## Trying it out
The website uses vanilla html/css/js, so downloading the zip file or cloning the repository and opening the index.html file under the "Main Page" folder will open up the game in a browser. If you wish to clone the files, use the following command in a terminal window:

```
git clone git@github.com:shadowrider38/Recalculating...Game.git
```
